For my Capstone Project at USC, I helped code a Bookstore Web Application in React using the MERN Stack.  
In this project, I worked on much of the backend and how our team's app would be structured.  
I also served as the team's Agile Coach.  
You can learn more about that project here: https://github.com/SCCapstone/BookstoreApp  
  
I also developed a Web App in Vue for my Linear Algebra class. For the project, I developed a GUI  
that represents the Gram-Schmidt process for orthonormalizing a set of vectors.  
You can learn more about that project here: https://github.com/jackcoberman/gram-schmidt-math-544
